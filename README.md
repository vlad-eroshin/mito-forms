# Mito Forms - Declarative Editors frameworks

Mito Forms is the tool to build Form editors declaratively. The idea is to define UI form inputs in JSON and capture data from it. No need to write custom form components and come up with your own state management mechanism for caturing form data.

## Features:
- form definition in JSON
- Allows configuring Show/Hide fields logic depending on the user input.
- Allows capturing values from the complex JSON objects using JSON Path. This becomes helpful when input object is quite complex with different hierarchies.
- Can write back to the source object.
- Allows using different design systems and underlying component widget libraries. By default supports Material UI.
