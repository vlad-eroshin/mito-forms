# Form Editor Usage Documentation
The form editor is a component that allows you build forms declaratively using metadata only - no React code necessary.


## Basic Editor
This is a basic editor with a text field and selector component.

<Canvas of={EditorStories.Basic} />

## Simple layout (one page layout)
The one page layout puts all the forms and fieldsets in a single page. This is useful for simple editors with few fields.
<Canvas of={EditorStories.OnePageLayout} />

## Tabbed layout
Tabbed layout can be used to create a more complex editor.

<Canvas of={EditorStories.TabbedLayout} />


## Conditional Attributes
The conditional attributes allow you to set the attributes of a field based on the value of another field. This is useful for creating dynamic forms that change based on user input.

## Fieldset Reducers
Fieldset reducers provide controlled way to apply changes to the result.
